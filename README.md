## Mapping_Earthquakes

## Challenge Overview

The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.  This project was completed using a URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website and further retrieved geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days. The data was then added to the map.  The approach taken was to use the JavaScript and the D3.js library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data. The Leaflet library was used to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and create interactivity for the earthquake data.
